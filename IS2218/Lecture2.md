# Lecture 2: Platform Business Models

## Introduction
Traditional system employed by most businesses is a **Linear Value Chain**

```
Design --> Manufacture --> Sell --> Deliver
```
- e.g design in USA, Manufacture in China, India, Vietnam, Sell worldwide in stores

NEW Structure: **Platform** Structure

```
Producers --> Platform <-- Consumers
```
- Some of each, sometimes an entity acts as both at different times
- Connect and interact with one another using the resources provided by platform.
    - Result of process: Exchange, Consume, Co-create something of value
- Examples: Grab
    - Producers = Food / PHV Drivers
    - Consumers = Us!

## Advantages
1. No gatekeepers to manage flow
    - Anyone can be a producer / consumer
        - Traditionally, you would have to be popular (e.g as a writer) for others to invite you as a producer
    - 'Gatekeepers' replaced by market signals
        - If your product is good, more people will view / consume
    - Consumers have more freedom
        - Coursera vs Uni, Upwork vs Corporate Job
2. New sources of value and supply
    - AirBnB expands more rapidly compared to a hotel.
        - Doesn't own assets, expansion is less risky
        - Sharing economy (Optimize usage of idle assets)
3. Community feedback
    - Updated
    - wikipedia vs encyclopedia for example.

## Network Effects

- Impact that the number of users of a platform has on the value created for each user
    - More users. More value
    - Large, well-managed platforms = more value for user
    - But, badly managed platforms = less value for user
    - Growth is non-linear
        - 1 phone = useless
        - 2 phones = 1 connection
        - Millions of phones = so much more connections

- Industrial Revolution: Economies of scale
    - More quantity, Lower production cost
    - Internet era: Demand economies of scale
        - Pooling demands across different sectors


- Two sided
    - Producers and Consumers
        - e.g Riders attract Drivers, and the other way round (Uber)
    - Firms can spend money to attract participands to one side of the market
        - e.g Vouchers for riders / Increased share for drivers
    - Virality can attract people, but netweork effects keep them there.
    - Stark difference from price effects and brand effects
        - Price effects
            - Cheaper? (e.g budget airline vs premium)
        - Brand effects stickier, but harder to sustain
            - one-off screwups maybe ignorable if brand is known (more leeway given)
        - Network effect is very very sticky
            - Alot of riders, alot of drivers
                - Hard to leave

- The bad
    - Matching difficulty when numbers are high
        - e.g Chess.com bad matchmaking (big elo diff) -> Bad
        - Drives away participants
        - Balance frictionless entry with effective curation
            - e.g Fast queue times, but similar elo still.

### Network Effects: 4 kinds

1. Positive Same-side
    - More users of the same kind (e.g more telephone users, etc)
2. Negative Same-side
    - More participants in 1 side make it harder
        - e.g more drivers = more competition
3. Positive Cross-Side Effects
    - Users benefitting from more participants on other side
        - e.g mastercard benefits with more users.
4. Negative Cross-Side Effects
    - Matching problems and clutter

## Monetization - Making money from Network Effects
- Tricky
    - Value of platform business lies in network effects
        - Charge for users may discourage participation
        - Charging for usage may hinder usage
        - Charging for consumption may affect producers (lower consumption)
        - Charging for production may affect consumers

- Sources of Value
    - Consumers:
        - Access to value created on platform
    - Producers: 
        - Access to community or market
    - Both:
        - Tools and services that facilitate interaction
        - Curation mechanisms that improve interaction quality

- Sometimes monetization can improve network effects (opposite)
    - Meetup
        - Charge subscription fee for service
        - Increase successful meetups
            - Although reduced users 

### Monetization Methods

1. Transaction Fee
    - Balance between profit and not driving users away
    - Only transactions are charged
        - No discouragement from joining
2. Charging for access
    - Charge producers to access community of consumers
        - No discouragement of users
    - e.g LinkedIn recruiters
3. Charging for enhanced access
    - Producers: Enhanced access to consumers
    - Consumer: Lowering barriers
        - e.g Premium subscription to get more details
4. Charging for Enhanced Curation
    - Improve quality of interactions for paying
    - Enhance vetting / screening for a fee

### Monetization: Who to charge?
1. All users
    - Rare
    - Used as a vetting process
2. One side, while subsidizing another
3. Charging most users full price while subsidizing stars (e.g chess.com)
4. Price discrimination based on price sensitivity

### Monetization: Important Principles

1. Avoid charging for value that users previously got for free
2. Avoid reducing access to value that users are used to getting
3. Strive to create additional value to justify charges
4. Consider monetization when making initial platform design choices


## Metrics

- Traditional Pipeline business models
    - Efficiency
    - e.g
        - Cash flow
        - Inventory Turns
        - Operating Income
        - Gross MArgin
        - Overhead
        - ROI

- Platform Models
    - Network effects
        - Rate of interaction success
            - Factors that contribute to it
        - Focus on metrics that quantify success in generating desirable interactions

### Metrics during various phases

#### Startup:
- Growth of producers and consumers
    - Liquidity
        - Minimum number of producer / consumers.
        - High % of successful interactions
        - Active usage >>>> number of signups
        - Ratios and Comparative metrics are best
            - e.g active users / total users
            - e.g new active users / total active users
    - Matching Quality
        - Accuracy of search algorithm
        - % of search leading to interactions
            - Sales convertion rate
        - Correlation between interaction rate and long-term activity rate
            - e.g 40% and above = a long time user
    - Trust
        - How much risk is the user confortable with
            - Boost by:
                - Reviews
                - Curation
        - Critical in platforms where parties may interact for the first time
    - Platform specific:
        - Commitment to ecosystem
            - % of active users, time between interactions, etc
        - Outcome
            - Nights booked (AirBNB)
            - Number of work hours (Upwork)
        - Content creation
            - Consumer relevance (percentage of listings that receive positive response from potential customers)
            - Co-creation (percentage of listings that receive some minimum level of positive response from potential consumers)
        - Market access regardless of interactions
            - Registered women in dating sites
            - Restaurant Reservations
#### Growth:
- Once platform reaches a critical mass of users
    - Ensure platform is still growing
    - Balance between 2 sides to be maintained
        - Producer : Consumer ratio
    - Side switching rate
        - e.g airbnb guest -> airbnb host

- Producer Side
    - Frequency of producer participation
    - Listings created
    - Outcomes achieved
    - Interaction failure?
        - Interactions initiated, but not completed
    - Producer fraud
        - Did not deliver in time / false advertising
    - Retention and lifetime value (similar to traditional businesses)
        - Repeat producers are profitable
        - Low churn (low retention)

- Consumer side
    - Frequency of:
        - Consumption
        - Searches
    - Rate of:
        - Conversion to sale
    - Retention and lifetime value (similar to traditional businesses)
        - Loyalty / low churn

#### Maturity Phase
- Driving innovation
    - Adapt to needs of users in a competitive and regulatory environment


### Metrics: Conclusion

1. Actionable: Clear instructions for strategy / managerial decision
2. Accessible: Comprehensible to those who use this information
3. Auditable: Real and meaningful

## The future of the platform revolution
What businesses are likely to join?

1. Information Intensive industries
    - Platform = Information enabler
2. Non-scalable gatekeepers
    - Retail and publishing
3. Highly fragmented industries
    - Market aggregation through a platform increases efficiency and reduce search cost
        - e.g uber, airbnb
4. Extreme Information asymmetry
    - e.g used car dealers have more information about condition of car than customers

What businesses are likely to resist?

1. High regulatory control
    - Banks, education, healthcare
2. High failure cost
    - Matching patient with a bad doctor
3. Resource intensive industry
    - Mining, oil, agriculture

## Transformations

### Finance and fintech

1. Money is a form of value accepted by all participants in the economy
    - Sounds like a platform
2. QR Payment
3. Escrow payment
    - e.g PayPal - Money goes over only after product is delivered
4. P2P lending platforms, personal finance platforms
5. etc

### Logistics and Transportation

Originally, FedEx enjoyed competitive advantage with fleet of vehicles
- Platform approach doesn't require fleet ownership
- Platform can leverage on real-time market information
    - e.g Grab, GoJek
