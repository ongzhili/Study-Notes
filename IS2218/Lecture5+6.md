# Financial Statement Analysis

## Market Value Measures

- Market Capitalization (Market Cap)
    - Total market value of equity, equal to share price times number of shares outstanding
    - (\# shares) * (price per share)
- Market Value Added
    - = Market Cap - equity
        - "How well the company has done with whatever money was invested in it"
        - Higher is better
- Market-to-Book ratio
    - market value of equity : book value of equity
        - Just a ratio instead of a subtraction
            - Good to compare companies of different scales
                - Bigger companies have more resources than smaller companies 
                - How much have you converted the shareholder's investment to current market value

### Market Value Metrics: Drawbacks

- Reflects investors' expectations about future performance
- Fluctuate due to risks and events outside of financial manager's controls
    - Noisy
    - e.g Trump tariffs dropping stock prices / COVID
- Privately owned companies: market value cant be looked up
    - No obligation for private companies to publish balance/income sheets
    - No balance / income sheet specific to a division

## Economic Value Added (EVA)

- Net income (money you make) - residual income
    - residual income is a charge for the cost of capital employed
        - cost of capital will be given for IS2218
    - residual income = net dollar return after deducting cost of capital
- EVA = After tax operating income - (Cost of capital * total capitalization)
    - **Total Capitalization = Long-term debt + Equity (shareholder equity)**
    - **Cost of capital is given in exam** 
    - 2nd part of equation is sort of like "opportunity cost of the company"
    - **After tax operating income** - What the firm would earn if it had no debt (100% equity financed)
    - = (1 - tax rate) * interest expense + net income
        - You dont pay tax on the interest expense, so you "simulate" paying tax
    - = EBIT x (1 - tax rate)

### Advantages of EVA
- EVA Recognizes that companies need to cover their opportunity costs before adding value
- EVA Makes cost of capital visible to operating managers
    - Clear target: Earn at least cost of capital on assets employed
- EVA can be improved by reducing assets that are not contributing enough to profits

### Disadvantages
- Not affected by everything else that moves stock market
    - Aside from current performance
- Book values are used.
    - Older assets may be undervalued
        - e.g using a vehicle for 20y when depreciation considered for 10y -> theoratically 'free' for 10y
        - High ROA indicates business **DID** well using assets acquired in the **PAST**

## Accounting Rates of Return (ROR)
- Return on Capital (ROC)
    - How much money your company is generating based on all the long-term capital it has.
        - Long-term capital = equity + long-term debt
    - After tax operating income as a % of long-term capital **(Long-term Debt + Equity)**
    - = after-tax operating income / total capitalization
- Return on Assets (ROA)
    - Income that your company earn as a % of total assets
    - After tax operating income as a % of total assets **(Liabilities + Equity)**
    - = after-tax operating income / total assets
- Return on Equity (ROE)
    - Net income / shareholder equity


## Measuring Efficiency

### Asset Turnover Ratio

- ATR = Sales / Total Assets at start of year
    - or Sales / Average total assets

### Inventory Turnover
- IT = cost of goods sold / inventory at start of year

- avg. days in inventory = inventory at start of year / (cost of goods sold / 365)


## Profit

### The DuPont System / Formula

- Profit Margin
    - = net income / sales

- Operating Profit Margin
    - = after-tax operating income / sales

- ROA = after-tax operating income / sales
    - => ROA = (sales / assets) * (ATOI / sales)
        - = asset turnover * operating profit margin

In industries with rapid asset turnover, competition forces prices down, reducing profit margin (high asset turnover + high profit margin = many will come to industry)
    - ROA is between 3% - 10% for almost all companies

## Financial Leverage

- Long-term debt ratio = long-term debt / long-term debt + equity
- Long-term debt-equity ratio = long-term debt / equity
- Leverage helps equity holders in good times but harms them in bad times
    - Higher leverage = higher risk (larger part of capitalization is debt)

- total debt ratio = total liabilites / total assets
- times interest earned = EBIT / interest payments
- cash coverage ratio = EBIT + depreciation / interest payment

- $ROE = \frac{assets}{equity} * \frac{sales}{assets} * \frac{ATOI}{sales} * \frac{net-income}{ATOI}$
    - = leverage ratio * asset turnover * operating profit margin * debt burden
    - note that assets = debt + equity, so $\frac{assets}{equity} = 1 + \frac{debt}{equity}$


## Liquidity
Make sure you have enough to pay debt holders / suppliers / whoever you owe money
- Net working capital to total assets ratio = net working capital / total assets = (current assets - current liabilities) / total assets
- Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities

Remove inventory part, only consider cash and marketable securities (easy to sell)
- Quick ratio = cash + marketable securities + recievables / current liabilities
- Cash ratio = cash + marketable securities / current liabilities
